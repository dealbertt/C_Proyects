This project is done based on an Arcanoid game we had to do on my Computer Arquitechture and Organization in Z80 assembly language

i need something to go 450 to the left and 540 to the right
keeping in mind the borders are 20 pixels in width
so i would have to place the pad in 480 and 
1040 in width of the window
need to fix borders to fit the new resolution
