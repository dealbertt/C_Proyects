PROYECT NUMBER 2: Image Proccessing CLI
 This proyect aims to learn how to manipulate different image format

 I started with the PPM image, as its one the easieast formats to start with, specially with the P3 header, which displays pixel information
 in ASCII (r,g,b values)

 Once i got comfortable with that, I implemented the P6, which is much more efficient and used since it displays the information in binary


 The tool allows you to:
  -Apply grayscale to an exising image
  -Resize an image to a new desired width and heigth
  -Transform the image into ASCII code
