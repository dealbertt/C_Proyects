Things to do for this project:    
- Add text for information like swaps, array accesses and such(have to look on how to clear text when you want to render new text);  
- Keyboard shortcuts for stuff like stopping the execution, going one step at a time, or maybe going back one step at a time(i am thinking oof implementing a stack of steps, and you just pop them)
