Things to do for this project:    
- Add text for information like swaps, array accesses and such(have to look on how to clear text when you want to render new text);  
- Keyboard shortcuts for stuff like stopping the execution, going one step at a time, or maybe going back one step at a time(i am thinking oof implementing a stack of steps, and you just pop them)  
- Maybe consider, dividing each sorting algorithm in classes, with attributes like the array accesses, swaps and such, as well as a custom size of the array for each type of algorithm  
-Timers for keeping track of how much each algorithm took
