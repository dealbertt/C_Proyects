Welcome to a repo with a bunch of different C Proyects!
The aim of this repo is to improve my skills and explore different fields

List of Proyects:

1- Json Parser 
    -Needs to be optimized and implement the array struct
    -Maybe implement the CSV from DIS and transform it into json?
        -With the use of structs to act like java classes typeshit

2- Image Proccessor
    -List the files in the working directory
    -Choosing the name done
        -Check if the name is taken and add .ppm if not there
        -Maybe work around sanitizing the inputs
