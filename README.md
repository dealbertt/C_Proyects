Welcome to a repo with a bunch of different C Proyects!
The aim of this repo is to improve my skills and explore different fields

List of Proyects:

1- Json Parser 
    -Needs to be optimized and implement the array struct
    -Maybe implement the CSV from DIS and transform it into json?
        -With the use of structs to act like java classes typeshit


2- Image Proccessor
    -Create a file.h wwith functions like getHeader or printHeader in such so i can be used across many other files
        -Maybe work around sanitizing the inputs
    
    -Implement another option that transform an existing image into ASCII
