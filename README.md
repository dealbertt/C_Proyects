Welcome to a repo with a bunch of different C Proyects!
The aim of this repo is to improve my skills and explore different fields
(This repo has been abandonded, although i plan to come back in the future and improve (or finish) the projects that are in this repo, but i dont promise anything)
List of Proyects:
1- Json Parser 
    -Needs to be optimized and implement the array struct
    -Maybe implement the CSV from DIS and transform it into json?
        -With the use of structs to act like java classes typeshit


2- Image Proccessor
        -Maybe work around sanitizing the inputs
    -Implement another option that transform an existing image into ASCII
        -How to extract brightness out of rgb: 0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B
    -Get started with sdl to display image

3- Arcanoid Game
    This is an implementation of an arkanoid game we did in z80 assembly (which you can find in a repo), following the same structure on how to implement graphics and logic
    It was done using SDL, my first time using it
